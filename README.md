# sorted-array-repetitions-benchmark

Benchmark solutions for finding an element of the sorted array that appears less than a given number of times.

## Problem formulation

You are given a sorted array of integers where every element appears exactly K times, except for one element that appears fewer than K times. Your task is to find the element that occurs fewer than K times.

## Example

Array: [1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 9, 9, 9, 10, 10, 10]
K = 3
Answer: 7
